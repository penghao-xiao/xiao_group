We are a multidisciplinary computational group that spans **Ph**ysics, Chemistry (**pH**) and Materials Science. Research in my group focuses on understanding kinetic processes dictating the performance and durability of batteries and catalysts from first principles. These materials are constantly operated under non-equilibrium conditions and always contain various defects. To improve energy efficiency and lifetime of a device, it is necessary to understand ion diffusion and reaction coupled with the evolution of defects in materials. Our simulations will unveil factors affecting materials performances with atomistic details that are not easily accessible experimentally. Ultimately, our goal is to guide the atomistic-level control of materials for a sustainable future.
