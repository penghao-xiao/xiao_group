## PhD Positions in Atomistic Simulations of Li/Na-ion Batteries: Identifying Bottlenecks in Next-Generation Materials
 

The PHX Group is seeking two highly motivated PhD students to join our team. 
# Research Areas:
1.	Kinetic Processes in Battery Materials
– Li/Na diffusion during fast charging
– Cathode degradation under extended cycling
2.	Interfacial Reactions at Electrode-Electrolyte Interfaces
– Charge transfer barriers
– Electrolyte decomposition mechanisms
3.	Machine Learning for Materials Kinetics
– Development of ML-based tools to accelerate kinetic simulations

These positions are part of the Impact Projects funded by [Volt-Age](https://www.concordia.ca/research/volt-age/initiatives/impact-programs.html). Successful candidates may enroll through either the Department of Physics and Atmospheric Science or the Department of Chemistry at Dalhousie University.

# To Apply:
Please contact Dr. Penghao Xiao with the following materials:
1.	A brief research statement outlining your interests and goals
2.	A current CV
3.	Academic transcripts
