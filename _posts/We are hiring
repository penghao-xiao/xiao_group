Postdoc Position on diffusion, clustering and dissolution in alloys and oxides 

We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher with expertise on atomistic simulation of metal alloys and/or oxides. Our group employs density functional theory (DFT), nudged elastic band method under constant voltage (eNEB), cluster expansion, and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) to simulate long-timescale kinetics in materials. Our goal is to reach experimentally relevant timescale to make useful predictions on atomistic processes and the resulted macroscopic behaviors. The applications include structural alloys, as well as battery materials. 

The candidate will work closely with our experimental collaborators on Dalhousie campus, at the University of Toronto (Dr. Yu Zou), and from private sectors. 

Potential projects include but are not limited to: 
1)	Effects of minor elements on the corrosion of Ni-based alloy.
2)	Clustering in Al alloy during natural aging. 
3)	Transport and phase transition in battery cathodes.  


Interested candidates should directly contact Dr. Penghao Xiao (pxiao@dal.ca) with your cover letter and CV.
